/*
You have (x, y) coordinates for 2 points and need to find the distance between them.
Input:
Your program should read lines from the file. Each line contains two coordinate pairs which are space-delimited.
All x and y values are integers between -100 and 100.
Output:
Return the list of distance between the points. You do not need to round the results you receive.
Test 1
 (25, 4) (1, -6)
Expected Output 26.0
Test 2
 (47, 43) (-25, -11)
Expected Output 90.0
Constraints: Input file will have at least one line with valid coordinates.
